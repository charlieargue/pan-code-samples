# PAN Code Samples

Source of truth for all 2022 Code Samples

### Would Be Nice

- [ ] Keep it professional, nothing directly negative  
- [ ] Copy the Tao of React "Do and Don't" style but for how I got rid of technical debt  

### TODO

- [ ] Go thru my PAN Accomplishments + Resume and choose what needed from there  
- [ ] CODE SAMPLES  
- [ ] Drop in latest code-samples from my zips  
- [ ] Sanitize!  
- [ ] SCREENSHOTS  
- [ ] Go thru all my POKAZ and cherry pick  
- [ ] Do like a BLUR EFFECT on the AI App.js and how it was "all in one file" and then show the AFTER somehow...  
- [ ] LOOMS  
- [ ] BLURBS  
- [ ] Go thru all my LOOMS  
- [ ] add BLURBS to resume  
- [ ] add THIS to resume!  
- [ ] this should link to ctx-options  
- [ ] should be SOURCE of truth, and have a link to "other code samples and demo projecs"  

### UP NEXT

- [ ] Go thru BLUE FOLDER and org those notes  

### IN PROGRESS
