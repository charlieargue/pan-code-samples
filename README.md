		"Testing" :  5
```




## üíª Code Samples

`RTK-Q` = *Redux ToolKit - Query*

`MFE` = *Micro-Frontend*

`msw` = *Mock Service Worker*



### RTK-Q API, Endpoints, and Auto-Generated Hooks

*  [Example #1](code-samples/rtkq/api-endpoints-and-hooks.md)



### RTK-Q Builders 

* [Example #1](code-samples/rtkq/builders/example-1.md) (Get Pending Assets - Builder)
* [Example #2](code-samples/rtkq/builders/example-2.md) (Start Transfer - Builder)



### RTK-Q Cache Updates

* [Pessimistic Example](code-samples/rtkq/cache-updates/pessimistic.md) (code fragment)
* [Optimistic Example](code-samples/rtkq/cache-updates/optimistic.md) (code fragment)

* [General (from Component) Example](code-samples/rtkq/cache-updates/general.md)  (code fragment)



### Component Examples:

* [License "Temperature Gauges"](code-samples/components/temperature-gauges.md) (simple)
* [Incoming Popover](code-samples/components/incoming-popover.md) (simple)
* [Expiration Extension CTA](code-samples/components/IEECTA.md) (with **react-query** and **Jest** unit tests)
* [Transfer Asset Drawer](code-samples/components/transfer-asset-drawer.md) (more complex, with **StoryBook** & **Cypress** testing)



### Other Javascript Examples

* ["Fetcher" Service based on `fetch`](code-samples/javascript/fetch.md) 
* ["Fetcher" Service based `axios`](code-samples/javascript/axios.md) (for `RTK-Q`)



### POC / Spike Story Examples

- [ctx-options ("Context Options") ](https://github.com/charlieargue/ctx-options)
  - GitHub repo I made showing patterns for avoiding **React Context** "over-rendering", as well as data fetching and caching
  - `RTK-Q` was chosen team-wide based on this proof-of-concept




### Mocked API Server Examples

- [`msw` and `@mswjs/data`](code-samples/msw/msw.md) 



### CLI & Tooling Examples

- [token.js](code-samples/CLI-tooling/token.md) - automates repetitive daily developer chores
- [msw.js](code-samples/CLI-tooling/msw.md) - initializes and bootstraps `msw`  for any `MFE`



### Cypress Integration Tests

- [E2E tests and tooling](code-samples/cypress/e2e.md)



## üé¶ Demos and Videos

- [MSW Video](https://github.com/charlieargue/pan-code-samples/issues/1) (<2 min)
  - Follow-up video to team documentation I wrote, on how `msw` mocking works on React MFEs 

  - *I later automated all these implementation details into the MFE CLI*

- [29 Cypress E2E](https://github.com/charlieargue/pan-code-samples/issues/2) tests running against `msw` (3.5 min)

- [Demo of Asset Transfer Flows](https://github.com/charlieargue/pan-code-samples/issues/3) (before loading animations/skeletons were added)

## tldr; main impact:

- [ ] **msw/d** unblocked dysfunctional and regular being-blocked by BE
- [ ] delivered bug-free much-loved **features**, making the designer happy with pixel-perfect build-outs of his Figma prototypes:
  - [ ] license expiration temperature gauges
  - [ ] asset transfer flows 
  - [ ] entire AI and IEECTA

- [ ] guided my supervising **staff engineer** on the **latest** general software as well as React best practices, patterns, and trends ‚Äî he  adopted the following, amongst others:
  - [ ] Typora for markdown
  - [ ] having a centralized markdown-based knowledge base
  - [ ] switching to MBP (and guidance on that)
  - [ ] following React community leaders such as Kent Dobbs, Ben Awad and well-known guides such as Tao of React
  - [ ] purchasing the Epic React and JavaScript Testing workshops by Kent Dobbs, upon my personal recommendation
  - [ ] using Tabox for Chrome tab group management
  - [ ] using Github Desktop
  - [ ] using VSCode extensions such as: auto-imports, 
  - [ ] using VSCode keyboard short-cuts such as: auto-order/dedupe imports, 
  - [ ] NOT having prettier auto-format run upon each file save, but instead centralizing prettier formatting via `husky` hooks
  - [ ] Rule of 3s, ctx-options
  - [ ] separating App from Server state
- [ ] Created momentum, enthusiasm, and consensus on **future** architectural decisions and upgrades, such as:
  - [ ] upgrading to Next.js (or even Remix)
  - [ ] migrating to a monorepo, such as NX or turborepo
  - [ ] running Cypress E2E tests via GitHub actions (in parallel, across multiple machines)

- [ ] Serious productivity and DX improvements thru automation:
  - [ ] token auth (dozens of MFEs and environments!)
  - [ ] msw (everything faster! not dep. on unstable BE any more)
  - [ ] no more prettier, zsh aliases, ...





## Impact: Team Velocity & Productivity & DX

- [ ] ‚≠êÔ∏è**unblocking** blocked by BE: msw + msw/d
- [ ] repetitive chore automation üíö (puppeteer, saving hours of dev time!)
  - [ ] Before & After Processes: **token automation**
- [ ] linking, starting, and msw command shortcuts (via `zsh` config)
- [ ] MBP cheatsheet (**and LINK to it)**
- [ ] bringing in Postman shared collections
- [ ] any other cheatsheets?







## Impact: Tech Debt

* ctx-options
* rtk-query / separating App State from Server State
* class -> functional components
* state pyramid (include pic like üõç MC)
* etc...





# Impact: Testing

- [ ] include testing pyramid pic
- [ ] re-use of msw & msw/d
- [ ] cypress & E2E, include üî¥ BEFORE:       ‚úÖ AFTER: see `CSP-9659.xlsx` (blurred)



## Impact: Agile Rituals

Guided project management on:

- [ ] having Retros at end of sprint instead of during sprint
- [ ] splitting FE from BE in stand-ups
- [ ] de-coupling FE from BE in stories (separate integration stories)
- [ ] keeping stand-ups short, using call-outs in JIRA and slack, and leaning out amount of meetings



## Impact: Project Management

Guided project management on:

- [ ] how to switch from Visual to Text editing mode
- [ ] how to use markdown auto-outlining syntax
- [ ] what is an epic, how to write Acceptance Criteria, etc.
- [ ] benefits of markdown, mocking API servers, creating sub-tasks (of stories), linking issues, sharing Postman collections, and more
