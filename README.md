# Palo Alto Networks (PAN) ‚Äî Code Samples

Code samples, demos and videos, and a detailed "post-mortem" and case study of my time spent at Palo Alto Networks.



## üïô How I Spent My Time

```mermaid
pie
    title Time Spent at PAN
    "React UI / Features" : 40
    "Refactoring & Tech Debt" : 30
    "Tooling, CLI, Automation" : 15
    "Mentoring / Pair Sessions" :  10
		"Testing" :  5
```

## üíª Code Samples

`RTK` = *Redux ToolKit* (Redux basically)

`RTK-Q` = *Redux ToolKit - Query* (data fetching, cache management)

`MFE` = *Micro-Frontend*

`msw` = *Mock Service Worker*



### RTK-Q API, Endpoints, and Auto-Generated Hooks

*  [Example #1](code-samples/rtkq/api-endpoints-and-hooks.md)



### RTK-Q Builders 

* [Example #1](code-samples/rtkq/builders/example-1.md) (Get Pending Assets - Builder)
* [Example #2](code-samples/rtkq/builders/example-2.md) (Start Transfer - Builder)



### RTK-Q Cache Updates

* [Pessimistic Example](code-samples/rtkq/cache-updates/pessimistic.md) (code fragment)
* [Optimistic Example](code-samples/rtkq/cache-updates/optimistic.md) (code fragment)

* [General (from Component) Example](code-samples/rtkq/cache-updates/general.md)  (code fragment)



### Component Examples:

* [License "Temperature Gauges"](code-samples/components/temperature-gauges.md) (simple)
* [Incoming Popover](code-samples/components/incoming-popover.md) (simple)
* [Expiration Extension CTA](code-samples/components/IEECTA.md) (with **react-query** and **Jest** unit tests)
* [Transfer Asset Drawer](code-samples/components/transfer-asset-drawer.md) (more complex, with **StoryBook** & **Cypress** testing)



### Other Javascript Examples

* ["Fetcher" Service based on `fetch`](code-samples/javascript/fetch.md) 
* ["Fetcher" Service based `axios`](code-samples/javascript/axios.md) (for `RTK-Q`)



### POC / Spike Story Examples

- [ctx-options ("Context Options") ](https://github.com/charlieargue/ctx-options)
  - GitHub repo I made showing patterns for avoiding **React Context** "over-rendering" and state management
  - üöÄ**IMPACT:** 
    - Clarified a critical misunderstanding of **React Context**, causing dev leadership to bypass it unnecessarily and reach for other solutions (Redux) where it would suffice
    - Introduced a technique for optimizing performance, fixing memory leaks, and eliminating unnecessary over-renders (via [Why Did You Render](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render) library and a mix of standard solutions like `useSafeDispatch` or removing unnecessary dispatch calls)
    - `RTK` was chosen team-wide based on this proof-of-concept, and React Context was restored as a viable and primary solution for state management (both local and global)




### Mocked API Server Examples

- [`msw` and `@mswjs/data`](code-samples/msw/msw.md) 



### CLI & Tooling Examples

- [token.js](code-samples/CLI-tooling/token.md) - automates repetitive daily developer chores
- [msw.js](code-samples/CLI-tooling/msw.md) - initializes and bootstraps `msw`  for any `MFE`



### Cypress Integration Tests

- [E2E tests and tooling](code-samples/cypress/e2e.md)



## üé¶ Demos and Videos Samples

- [MSW Video](https://github.com/charlieargue/pan-code-samples/issues/1) (<2 min)
  - Follow-up video to team documentation I wrote, on how `msw` mocking works on React MFEs 

  - *I later automated all these implementation details into the MFE CLI*

- [29 Cypress E2E](https://github.com/charlieargue/pan-code-samples/issues/2) tests running against `msw` (3.5 min)

- [Demo of Asset Transfer Flows](https://github.com/charlieargue/pan-code-samples/issues/3) (before loading animations/skeletons were added)





## üëæ Sample Cheatsheet

- Team üíô-ed this [MBP "Setup Cheatsheet"](other/mbp-setup-cheatsheet.md) I made for improved DX and productivity

## üìù Sample Design Documents

Fragment from a `Hi-Level Design Doc` of all Asset Transfer workflows, helping to illustrate clearly:

* `Source` VS `Destination` users
* which MFE the action or event occurs in, i.e. ‚è∏ **`CPT`** VS üõ° **`NS`** 
* and current limitations (`FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS`)

![image-20220319081815248](/Users/karlgolka/PROJECTS/FYI/_typora_images/image-20220319081815248.png)





## üöÄ Positive Impact 



### Testing & Mocking

- Introduced a modern **testing infrastructure** **and tooling** (`msw`, Jest, Cypress), centralized so developers could use them from any MFE (including Jest and Cypress code coverage)

- Setup next-generation **API mocking** (`msw`), that allowed effortless request interception at the network level, and seamless re-use the same mock definitions for testing, development, and debugging

- Demonstrated successful use of **Cypress E2E tests** to confidently and quickly refactor entire MFEs, to hunt/fix/prevent bugs, and as a UI unit and component testing tool (against StoryBook stories)

- Introduced Postman as a critical tool for sharing collections between BE and FE during requirements-gathering phase

- While refactoring multiple MFEs, wrote highly-testable code so that services, components, utility functions, and custom hooks could all be exercised rigorously

- Guided team on what to test and how to test (see [Testing Pyramid](https://github.com/charlieargue/multi-cart#-testing), eg. how Jest component tests should check for an even handler being called where-as E2E tests should test that a toast message appeared, etc.)

- **üöÄ IMPACT:** 
  - Solved FE team's primary pain point of blockage by BE dysfunction and unstable BE environments
  - Super-charged development velocity and allowed for rapid prototyping
  - Developers stopped putting messy mocking code all over the codebases
  - Staff engineer started using Cypress/Jest/Postman/`msw` and our joint efforts led to complete adoption by the team
  - No testing was being done on my team when I arrived, and now the staff engineer and team are writing tests nearly daily and even doing occasional TDD
  - `msw/data` in particular allowed for mocked data persistence and allowed for effectively mocking entire complex workflows and building out entire features without waiting for the BE
  - Greatly improved team's capability to deliver bug-free features
  
  
  
  

### UI/UX Design Impact:

- Made the designer very happy with pixel-perfect build-outs of his Figma prototypes (thx [PerfectPixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en)!)
- Provided frequent useful feedback on better UI design (eg. better design of toasts and alerts for popovers in a DataTable context)
- Solved a major Data View pain-point by combining loading states for Asset Dashboard Tiles, Product Families, Search, Filters, and Data Table UI/UX, removing the need for a lot of code and buggy edge-cases (users were counter-intuitively running multiple searches at once without realizing it, resulting in race conditions, causing confusion both for users and developers)



### Mentoring to Staff Engineer 

- [ ] Provided regular guidance to my supervising **staff engineer** on the **latest** React (and general software) best practices, patterns, and trends ‚Äî he  adopted almost all of my suggestions, including but not limited to:
  - [ ] Advanced use of markdown and **Typora** (a markdown editor)
  
  - [ ] having a centralized, markdown-based **"Personal Knowledge Base"** in GitHub
  
  - [ ] switching to **MBP** (and guidance on setup and optimization)
  
  - [ ] following **React community leaders** such as Kent Dodds, Ben Awad, as patterns such as Tao of React, "Rule of Three" or "AHA Programming"
  
  - [ ] purchasing the **Epic React** and **JavaScript Testing workshops** by Kent Dodds, upon my personal recommendation
  
  - [ ] using **Tabox** for Chrome tab group management
  
  - [ ] using **Github Desktop**
  
  - [ ] **VSCode extensions**: auto-imports, spell checker, snippets, Quokka, themes, #region folding, bookmarks, Markdown to JIRA, CODDX Kanban Board, Turbo Console Log, Auto Barrel, and others
  
  - [ ] using **VSCode keyboard short-cuts** such as: auto-order/dedupe imports, auto-formatting, navigate back/forward, etc.
  
  - [ ] fixed annoying prettier auto-format that was running each time a developer saved a file, to instead run before commits via `husky`
  
  - [ ] Tao of React, Rule of 3s, AHA Programming
  
  - [ ] separating state into two categories: App state from Server state (and not keeping everything in Redux)
  
  - [ ] successfully implementing various latest patterns and libraries for state-management, data fetching, and cache management options, including pure React Context, react-tracked, react-query, and RTK-Q (Redux was already being used)                                          
  
  - [ ] clearing up misunderstandings that caused the team to shy away from pure React Context
  
  - [ ] provided clear POC repo [ctx-options](https://github.com/charlieargue/ctx-options) to demonstrate common state management solutions and patterns for dealing with React Context over-renders
  
  - [ ] successfully pushing to setup a shared PostMan collection for the team
  
  - [ ] centralizing library exports and cheatsheets in a separate dev-tools repo
  
  - [ ] establishing caching patterns and strategies
  
  - [ ] next generation API mocking for testing and development
  
  - [ ] component-based rapid prototyping with StoryBook (and then using those stories for component UI unit tests via Cypress)
  
    
  
    
  
  

### Mentoring to Other Junior & Senior Team Members

- [ ] taking less experienced dev under my wing and helping thru frequent pair programming sessions
- [ ] guidance on entire dev workflows, specifically how to use:
  - [ ] StoryBook for **rapid UI prototyping**
  - [ ] `msw` and `@mswjs/data` for **rapid development** against a mocked API (wiring up data and behavior)
  - [ ] Postman, Jest, and Cypress for building an efficient and robust **testing pyramid**
  - [ ] other tips and best practices (see cheatsheet)



### Team Productivity & DX

- [ ] repetitive chore automation üíö (puppeteer, saving hours of dev time, (dozens of MFEs and environments!)
  - [ ] Before & After Processes: **token automation**
- [ ] linking, starting, and msw command shortcuts (via `zsh` config)
- [ ] no more prettier sheesh! introduced husky
- [ ] VSCode extensions, chrome extensions, see MBP cheatsheet
- [ ] husky & the DISABLE_PRETTIER flag (before that, each time a developer would save their file, the prettier auto-format would run, losing their place on the screen, un-folding all folded code, and causing all sorts of other headaches)
- [ ] using [loom](https://www.loom.com/) videos to quickly and easily communicate status updates on features, and much more



### Future Directions

Created momentum, enthusiasm, and consensus on future architectural decisions and upgrades, such as:

- [ ] upgrading to **Next.js** (team now even considering **Remix**!)
- [ ] migrating to a **monorepo**, such as **NX**  (team now even considering **TurboRepo**!)
- [ ] running Cypress E2E tests in **CICD** via **GitHub actions** and **Cypress Dashboard** (provided .yml scripts for running E2E tests in parallel, across multiple machines)
- [ ] guidance on how to create **"Testing Sandboxes"** (by dynamically generating test roles, accounts, users, assets, etc.)
- [ ] guidance on how to setup screenshot **UI Regression Testing** (via Happo, StoryBook, and Cypress)



### Tech Debt

* ctx-options
* rtk-query / separating App State from Server State
* class -> functional components
* state pyramid (include pic like üõç MC)
* etc...





### Agile and Project Management

Introduced:

- proper Acceptance Criteria
- epic kick-offs (w/ design-docs for medium-to-hard stories)
- post-mortems
- 1-on-1s 



Guided project management on:

- [ ] having Retros at end of sprint instead of during sprint
- [ ] NOT re-defining Stand-ups (they wanted to change them to be normalized around features instead of team members)
- [ ] splitting FE from BE in stand-ups
- [ ] de-coupling FE from BE in stories (separate integration stories)
- [ ] keeping stand-ups short, using call-outs in JIRA and slack, and leaning out amount of meetings
- [ ] how to switch from Visual to Text editing mode
- [ ] how to use markdown auto-outlining syntax
- [ ] what is an epic, how to write Acceptance Criteria, etc.
- [ ] how to attach images inline (and not at bottom) of description
- [ ] how to insert markdown tables and formatted code blocks
- [ ] benefits of markdown, mocking API servers, creating sub-tasks (of stories), linking issues, sharing Postman collections, and more
- [ ] lessening the amount of meetings (amount was affecting the team's development productivity)
- [ ] guidance on ceremonies: when and how to have/do Sprint Planning

### Simplified "Where to Put State" Flow Chart

Inspired by [Kent Dodds' decision tree chart](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster#so-how-do-you-decide-where-to-put-state):

```mermaid
graph TD
      A(Where to put state?) --> B(#1 - data fetching and cache management tool)
      B --> |eg. RTK-Q| C{#2 - If not server state, then app state:}
      C --> D(useState)
      C --> E(lift or co-locate)
      C --> F(component composition)
      C --> G(prop drilling)
      C --> H(Context)
      D --> I(#3 - Redux)
      E --> I
      F --> |... and as a last resort ...|I
      G --> I
      H --> I
```



### My "JIRA Process" 

From a FE Perspective:

```mermaid

      A(("üéΩ Start with an EPIC")) --> B("üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èMedium-to-hard sprint points need a short DESIGN DOC")
      B --> |"üé® UI/UX Figma, prototypes, hand-offs"| C("üìå `PIN POINTS` mapping each endpoint to UI/UX")
      C --> D("üì¨ POSTMAN  endpoints, payloads, etc.")
      D ==> |if design doc exists| E{"üñã Team sign-off on design doc"}
      E --> |Assign to team members| F("ü™ì  Break into STORIES, write full AC/requirements, weigh points")
      F --> |FE, BE, PROXY, INTEGRATION stories| G("üñ® Clone stories as needed for team")

# ‚è≥ Reasons for Transition

- [ ] Hanford / pm and "we decided to re-define what an epic is: an epic is a sub-task now"
- [ ] BE and PM dysfunction with no hope of course-correction in any reasonable amount of time
- [ ] Mazen Ghalayini (things like his code for incrementally refactoring from pixels to rem):

// ‚úÖ AFTER: 
// I proposed refactoring this file to a function instead of a never-ending object map, like so:
const remCalc = (pixelValue) => {
   // for now: 
   return pixelValue === 0 ? '0' : `'${value}px'`;
   // then later: pixelValue / x = rems ...
   // and much later: just use rems ... (once legacy ASP.NET CSS issue refactored)
};
