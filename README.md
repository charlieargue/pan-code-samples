# Palo Alto Networks (PAN) Code Samples





## tldr; main impact:

- [ ] **msw/d** unblocked dysfunctional and regular being-blocked by BE
- [ ] delivered bug-free much-loved **features**, making the designer happy with pixel-perfect build-outs of his Figma prototypes:
  - [ ] license expiration temperature guages
  - [ ] asset transfer flows 
  - [ ] entire AI and IEECTA

- [ ] guided my supervising **staff engineer** on the **latest** general software as well as React best practices, patterns, and trends — he  adopted the following, amongst others:
  - [ ] Typora for markdown
  - [ ] having a centralized markdown-based knowledge base
  - [ ] switching to MBP (and guidance on that)
  - [ ] following React community leaders such as Kent Dobbs, Ben Awad and well-known guides such as Tao of React
  - [ ] purchasing the Epic React and Javacsript Testing workshops by Kent Dobbs, upon my personal recommendation
  - [ ] using Tabox for Chrome tab group management
  - [ ] using Github Desktop
  - [ ] using VSCode extensions such as: auto-imports, 
  - [ ] using VSCode keyboard short-cuts such as: auto-order/dedupe imports, 
  - [ ] NOT having prettier auto-format run upon each file save, but instead centralizing prettier formatting via `husky` hooks
  - [ ] Rule of 3s, ctx-options
  - [ ] separating App from Server state
- [ ] Created momentum, enthusiasm, and consus on **future** architectural decisions and upgrades, such as:
  - [ ] upgrading to Next.js (or even Remix)
  - [ ] migrating to a monorepo, such as NX or turborepo
  - [ ] running Cypress E2E tests via GitHub actions (in parallel, across multiple machines)

- [ ] Serios productivity and DX improvements thru automation:
  - [ ] token auth (dozens of MFEs and environments!)
  - [ ] msw (everything faster! not dep. on unstable BE any more)
  - [ ] no more prettier, zsh aliases, ...






## Code Samples

- [ ] axios Base Query, 
- [ ] fetcherService, 
- [ ] builders
- [ ] cache (pessimistic, optimized, and general) ... pull from bkups... and 
- [ ] ... IEECTA was originally in rtk-query, right??? or was there a version b4 that? react-tracked? ... something changed in how the cache was done, no? check...

- [ ] Sanitzed 🔴 BEFORE:       ✅ AFTER:
  - [ ] units.js
  - [ ] App.js 
  - [ ] AI in generale
  - [ ] MFE-B might be good, b-and-a
  - [ ] useFetch and everything in redux lol -> rtk-query + cache
  - [ ] bindClass service stuff -> builders only super lean, show size
  - [ ] barelling and better import/export patterns

## Impact: Team Velocity & Productivity & DX

- [ ] ⭐️**onblocking** blocked by BE: msw + msw/d
- [ ] repetitive chore automation 💚 (pupetteer, saving hours of dev time!)
  - [ ] Before & After Processes: **token automation**
- [ ] linking, starting, and msw command shortcuts (via `zsh` config)
- [ ] MBP cheatsheet (**and LINK to it)**
- [ ] bringing in Postman shared collections
- [ ] any other cheatsheets?







## Impact: Tech Debt

* ctx-options
* rtk-query / separating App State from Server State
* class -> functional components
* state pyramid (include pic like 🛍 MC)
* etc...





# Impact: Testing

- [ ] include testing pyramid pic
- [ ] re-use of msw & msw/d



## Impact: Agile Rituals

Guided project management on:

- [ ] having Retros at end of sprint instead of during sprint
- [ ] splitting FE from BE in stand-ups
- [ ] de-coupling FE from BE in stories (separate integration stories)
- [ ] keeping stand-ups short, using call-outs in JIRA and slack, and leaning out amount of meetings



## Impact: Project Management

Guided project management on:

- [ ] how to switch from Visual to Text editing mode
- [ ] how to use markdown auto-outlining syntax
- [ ] what is an epic, how to write Acceptance Criteria, etc.
- [ ] benefits of markdown, mocking API servers, creating sub-tasks (of stories), linking issues, sharing Postman collections, and more



## Testimonials

- [ ] pics
- [ ] audio
- [ ] transcripts/quotes/blurbs
  - [ ] PR's 100%, no bugs, refactored entire MFE w/i 1 month of being there, no bugs/revisions from QA/UAT!
