# PAN Code Samples

Code samples, demos and videos, and a detailed "post-mortem" and case study of my time spent at Palo Alto Networks.



# üïô How I Spent My Time

```mermaid
pie
    title Time Spent at PAN
    "React UI / Features" : 40
    "Refactoring & Tech Debt" : 30
    "Tooling, CLI, Automation" : 15
    "Mentoring / Pair Sessions" :  10
		"Testing" :  5
```

# üíª Code Samples

<u>Terminology</u>:

`RTK` = *Redux ToolKit* (Redux basically)

`RTK-Q` = *Redux ToolKit - Query* (data fetching, cache management)

`MFE` = *Micro-Frontend*

`msw` = *Mock Service Worker*



### RTK-Q API, Endpoints, and Auto-Generated Hooks

*  [Example #1](code-samples/rtkq/api-endpoints-and-hooks.md)



### RTK-Q Builders 

* [Example #1](code-samples/rtkq/builders/example-1.md) (Get Pending Assets - Builder)
* [Example #2](code-samples/rtkq/builders/example-2.md) (Start Transfer - Builder)



### RTK-Q Cache Updates

* [Pessimistic Example](code-samples/rtkq/cache-updates/pessimistic.md) (code fragment)
* [Optimistic Example](code-samples/rtkq/cache-updates/optimistic.md) (code fragment)

* [General (from Component) Example](code-samples/rtkq/cache-updates/general.md)  (code fragment)



### Component Examples:

* [License "Temperature Gauges"](code-samples/components/temperature-gauges.md) (simple)
* [Incoming Popover](code-samples/components/incoming-popover.md) (simple)
* [Expiration Extension CTA](code-samples/components/IEECTA.md) (with **react-query** and **Jest** unit tests)
* [Transfer Asset Drawer](code-samples/components/transfer-asset-drawer.md) (more complex, with **StoryBook** & **Cypress** testing)



### Other Javascript Examples

* ["Fetcher" Service based on `fetch`](code-samples/javascript/fetch.md) 
* ["Fetcher" Service based `axios`](code-samples/javascript/axios.md) (for `RTK-Q`)



### POC / Spike Story Examples

- [ctx-options ("Context Options") ](https://github.com/charlieargue/ctx-options)
  - GitHub repo I made showing patterns for avoiding **React Context** "over-rendering" and state management
  - üöÄ**IMPACT:** 
    - Clarified a critical misunderstanding of **React Context**, causing dev leadership to bypass it unnecessarily and reach for other solutions (Redux) where it would suffice
    - Introduced a technique for optimizing performance, fixing memory leaks, and eliminating unnecessary over-renders (via [Why Did You Render](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render) library and a mix of standard solutions like `useSafeDispatch` or removing unnecessary dispatch calls)
    - `RTK` was chosen team-wide based on this proof-of-concept, and React Context was restored as a viable and primary solution for state management (both local and global)




### Mocked API Server Examples

- [`msw` and `@mswjs/data`](code-samples/msw/msw.md) 



### CLI & Tooling Examples

- [token.js](code-samples/CLI-tooling/token.md) - automates repetitive daily developer chores
- [msw.js](code-samples/CLI-tooling/msw.md) - initializes and bootstraps `msw`  for any `MFE`



### Cypress Integration Tests

- [E2E tests and tooling](code-samples/cypress/e2e.md)



# üé¶ Demos and Videos Samples

- [MSW Video](https://github.com/charlieargue/pan-code-samples/issues/1) (<2 min)
  - Follow-up video to team documentation I wrote, on how `msw` mocking works on React MFEs 

  - *I later automated all these implementation details into the MFE CLI*

- [29 Cypress E2E](https://github.com/charlieargue/pan-code-samples/issues/2) tests running against `msw` (3.5 min)

- [Demo of Asset Transfer Flows](https://github.com/charlieargue/pan-code-samples/issues/3) (before loading animations/skeletons were added)





# üëæ Sample Cheatsheet

- Team üíô-ed this [MBP "Setup Cheatsheet"](other/mbp-setup-cheatsheet.md) I made for improved DX and productivity

![image-20220319081815248](_markdown_assets/images/image-20220319081815248.png)





# üöÄ Positive Impact 



### `Impact on:` Testing & Mocking

- Introduced a modern **testing infrastructure** **and tooling** (`msw`, Jest, Cypress), centralized so developers could use them from any MFE (including Jest and Cypress code coverage)

- Setup next-generation **API mocking** (`msw`), that allowed effortless request interception at the network level, and seamless re-use the same mock definitions for testing, development, and debugging

- Demonstrated successful use of **Cypress E2E tests** to confidently and quickly refactor entire MFEs, to hunt/fix/prevent bugs, and as a UI unit and component testing tool (against StoryBook stories)

- Introduced Postman as a critical tool for sharing collections between BE and FE during requirements-gathering phase

- While refactoring multiple MFEs and building new features, wrote **clean, bug-free, and highly-testable code** so that services, components, utility functions, and custom hooks could all be exercised rigorously

- Guided team on what to test and how to test (see [Testing Pyramid](https://github.com/charlieargue/multi-cart#-testing), eg. how Jest component tests should check for an even handler being called where-as E2E tests should test that a toast message appeared, etc.)

- **üöÄ IMPACT:** 
  
  - Solved FE team's primary pain point of blockage by BE dysfunction and unstable BE environments
  - Super-charged development velocity and allowed for rapid prototyping
  - Developers stopped putting messy mocking code all over the codebases
  - Staff engineer started using Cypress/Jest/Postman/`msw` and our joint efforts led to complete adoption by the team
  - No testing was being done on my team when I arrived, and now the staff engineer and team are writing tests nearly daily and even doing occasional TDD
  - `msw/data` in particular allowed for mocked data persistence and allowed for effectively mocking entire complex workflows and building out entire features without waiting for the BE
  - Greatly improved team's capability to deliver bug-free features
  
  

### `Impact on:` UI/UX Design

- Made the designer very happy with pixel-perfect build-outs of his Figma prototypes (thx [PerfectPixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en)!)
- Provided frequent useful feedback on better UI design (eg. better design of toasts and alerts for popovers in a DataTable context)
- Solved a major Data View pain-point by combining loading states for Asset Dashboard Tiles, Product Families, Search, Filters, and Data Table UI/UX, removing the need for a lot of code and buggy edge-cases (users were counter-intuitively running multiple searches at once without realizing it, resulting in race conditions, causing confusion both for users and developers)



### `Impact on:` Supervising Staff Engineer 

- [ ] Provided regular guidance to my supervising **staff engineer** on the **latest** React (and general software) best practices, patterns, and trends ‚Äî he  adopted almost all of my suggestions, including but not limited to:
  - [ ] Advanced use of markdown and **Typora** (a markdown editor)
  
  - [ ] having a centralized, markdown-based **"Personal Knowledge Base"** in GitHub
  
  - [ ] switching to **MBP** (and guidance on setup and optimization)
  
  - [ ] following **React community leaders** such as Kent Dodds, Ben Awad, as patterns such as Tao of React, "Rule of Three" or "AHA Programming"
  
  - [ ] purchasing the **Epic React** and **JavaScript Testing workshops** by Kent Dodds, upon my personal recommendation
  
  - [ ] using **Tabox** for Chrome tab group management
  
  - [ ] using **Github Desktop**
  
  - [ ] **VSCode extensions**: auto-imports, spell checker, snippets, Quokka, themes, #region folding, bookmarks, Markdown to JIRA, CODDX Kanban Board, Turbo Console Log, Auto Barrel, and others
  
  - [ ] using **VSCode keyboard short-cuts** such as: auto-order/dedupe imports, auto-formatting, navigate back/forward, etc.
  
  - [ ] fixed annoying prettier auto-format that was running each time a developer saved a file, to instead run before commits via `husky`
  
  - [ ] Tao of React, Rule of 3s, AHA Programming
  
  - [ ] separating state into two categories: App state from Server state (and not keeping everything in Redux)
  
  - [ ] successfully implementing various latest patterns and libraries for state-management, data fetching, and cache management options, including pure React Context, react-tracked, react-query, and RTK-Q (Redux was already being used)                                          
  
  - [ ] clearing up misunderstandings that caused the team to shy away from pure React Context
  
  - [ ] provided clear POC repo [ctx-options](https://github.com/charlieargue/ctx-options) to demonstrate common state management solutions and patterns for dealing with React Context over-renders
  
  - [ ] successfully pushing to setup a shared PostMan collection for the team
  
  - [ ] centralizing library exports and cheatsheets in a separate dev-tools repo
  
  - [ ] establishing caching patterns and strategies
  
  - [ ] next generation API mocking for testing and development
  
  - [ ] component-based rapid prototyping with StoryBook (and then using those stories for component UI unit tests via Cypress)
  
    
  

### `Impact on:` Other Junior & Senior Team Members

- [ ] taking less experienced dev under my wing and helping thru frequent pair programming sessions
- [ ] guidance on entire dev workflows, specifically how to use:
  - [ ] StoryBook for **rapid UI prototyping**
  - [ ] `msw` and `@mswjs/data` for **rapid development** against a mocked API (wiring up data and behavior)
  - [ ] Postman, Jest, and Cypress for building an efficient and robust **testing pyramid**
  - [ ] other tips and best practices (see cheatsheet)



### `Impact on:` Team Productivity & DX

- [ ] repetitive chore automation üíö (puppeteer, saving hours of dev time, (dozens of MFEs and environments!)
  - [ ] Before & After Processes: **token automation**
- [ ] linking, starting, and msw command shortcuts (via `zsh` config)
- [ ] no more prettier sheesh! introduced husky
- [ ] VSCode extensions, chrome extensions, see MBP cheatsheet
- [ ] husky & the DISABLE_PRETTIER flag (before that, each time a developer would save their file, the prettier auto-format would run, losing their place on the screen, un-folding all folded code, and causing all sorts of other headaches)
- [ ] using [loom](https://www.loom.com/) videos to quickly and easily communicate status updates on features, and much more



### `Impact on:` Agile and Project Management

<u>Introduced</u>:

- proper Acceptance Criteria
- epic kick-offs (w/ design-docs for medium-to-hard stories)
- post-mortems
- 1-on-1s 

<u>Guided project management on:</u>

- having Retros at end of sprint instead of during sprint
- NOT re-defining Stand-ups (they wanted to change them to be normalized around features instead of team members)
- splitting FE from BE in stand-ups
- de-coupling FE from BE in stories (separate integration stories)
- keeping stand-ups short, using call-outs in JIRA and slack, and leaning out amount of meetings
- how to switch from Visual to Text editing mode
- how to use markdown auto-outlining syntax
- what is an epic, how to write Acceptance Criteria, etc.
- how to attach images inline (and not at bottom) of description
- how to insert markdown tables and formatted code blocks
- benefits of markdown, mocking API servers, creating sub-tasks (of stories), linking issues, sharing Postman collections, and more
- lessening the amount of meetings (amount was affecting the team's development productivity)
- guidance on ceremonies: when and how to have/do Sprint Planning



### `Impact on:` Future Directions

Created momentum, enthusiasm, and consensus on future architectural decisions and upgrades, such as:

- [ ] upgrading to **Next.js** (team now even considering **Remix**!)
- [ ] migrating to a **monorepo**, such as **NX**  (team now even considering **TurboRepo**!)
- [ ] running Cypress E2E tests in **CICD** via **GitHub actions** and **Cypress Dashboard** (provided .yml scripts for running E2E tests in parallel, across multiple machines)
- [ ] guidance on how to create **"Testing Sandboxes"** (by dynamically generating test roles, accounts, users, assets, etc.)
- [ ] guidance on how to setup screenshot **UI Regression Testing** (via Happo, StoryBook, and Cypress)
- [ ] guidance on using [Plop](https://plopjs.com/) to **automatically generate** and scaffold new files with consistency

### Simplified "Where to Put State" Flow Chart

Inspired by [Kent Dodds' decision tree chart](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster#so-how-do-you-decide-where-to-put-state):

```mermaid
graph TD
      A(Where to put state?) --> B(#1 - data fetching and cache management tool)
      B --> |eg. RTK-Q| C{#2 - If not server state, then app state:}
      C --> D(useState)
      C --> E(lift or co-locate)
      C --> F(component composition)
      C --> G(prop drilling)
      C --> H(Context)
      D --> I(#3 - Redux)
      E --> I
      F --> |... and as a last resort ...|I
      G --> I

# ‚è≥ Reasons for Transition



### A) Project Management

Project Management lacked skills,  did Agile "their way", only adding to already-existing serious dysfunction, and proved impervious to course correction and advice:



#### They decided to <u>re-define an Epic</u> down to the Sub-Task level in JIRA's hierarchy

- thereby breaking how branches are made and used
- and creating exponentially more epics, stories, and sub-tasks than necessary

#### They wanted to <u>re-define Stand-ups</u> so as to normalize them around features instead of team members

- so instead of 
  - **Person 1**: `yesterday, today, blockers: All Features` 
  - **Person 2**: `yesterday, today, blockers: All Features`
  - etc...
- they wanted:
  - **Feature A**: *Person 1:* `yesterday, today, blockers`
  - **Feature A**: *Person 2:* `yesterday, today, blockers`
  - **Feature B**: *Person 1:* `yesterday, today, blockers`
  - **Feature B**: *Person 2:* `yesterday, today, blockers`
  - **Feature C**: *Person 1:* `yesterday, today, blockers`
  - **Feature C**: *Person 2:* `yesterday, today, blockers`
- this was decided upon in a context of already-dysfunctional Agile processes, where daily Stand-up ceremonies regularly took more than one hour and did little to relieve team blockage



### B) Supervising Staff Engineer

As an example, I received push-back (but finally prevailed) when suggesting that we DO NOT keep adding to this file infinitely, and instead refactor it into one line:

```js 
// file: /src/utils/units.js

// EXAMPLE USAGE: `padding: ${units[30]};`

// -----------------------
// üî¥ BEFORE:       
// -----------------------
export default {
    0: '0',
    1: '1px',
    2: '2px',
    3: '3px',
    4: '4px',
    6: '6px',
    7: '7px',
    8: '8px',
    9: '9px',
    10: '10px',
    11: '11px',
    12: '12px',
    14: '14px',
    15: '15px',
    16: '16px',
    17: '17px',
    18: '18px',
    20: '20px',
    22: '22px',
    24: '24px',

    30: '30px',
    32: '32px',
    33: '33px',
    35: '35px',
    36: '36px',
    40: '40px',
    44: '44px',

    64: '64px',
    72: '72px',
    76: '76px',
    80: '80px',
    96: '96px',
    112: '112px',
    128: '128px',
    144: '144px',
    160: '160px',
    168: '168px',
    176: '176px',
    184: '184px',

    450: '450px',
    384: '384px',
    541: '541px',
  
  // So, for example, if you needed a width of 542px or a line-height of 31px in a MFE, 
    // you had to go here and add that line explicitly, bump up the versions, 
    // and re-link the repo so you could use it in a MFE, etc.
};

// -----------------------
// ‚úÖ AFTER: 
// -----------------------
const remCalc = (pixelValue) => {
   return pixelValue === 0 ? '0' : `'${value}px'`;

   // THEN LATER:       pixelValue / x = rems 
   // AND MUCH LATER:   switch to just using rems, once legacy ASP.NET CSS issue fixed
};
